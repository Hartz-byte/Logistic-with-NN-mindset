# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
This is a practice project where I implemented a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats in images. The goal of this project is to build and understand a simple classification model using the foundational concepts of neural networks.

---

## Project Overview
The project walks through building a logistic regression model with a neural network mindset by:
- Initializing model parameters
- Calculating the cost function and gradients
- Using gradient descent for optimization
- Combining all parts into a complete learning algorithm
- Applying sigmoid activation
- Standardizing the dataset for better performance

---

## What You'll Learn
- How to structure a learning algorithm
- Implement parameter initialization, forward, and backward propagation
- Optimize parameters using gradient descent
- Understand the impact of the  learning rate
- Interpret training and testing accuracy

---

## Dataset
The model is trained to identify if an image contains a cat or not.

## Performance
- Training Accuracy: 99.04%
- Testing Accuracy: 70.00%

Note: The model has good training accuracy, but testing accuracy indicates room for improvement.

## Future Improvements
This repository is a work in progress. I plan to improve the model performance by experimenting with:
- More advanced architectures
- Better regularization techniques
- Larger and more diverse datasets
- Hyperparameter tuning

---

## How to Use
- Clone the repository
- Run the Jupyter notebook to train and test the model
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and model settings
